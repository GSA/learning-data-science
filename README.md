# learning-data-science
A repo for learning data science through Python.
# Description:

This repo is a liberal arts student's attempt to learn the tools and methods of data science. As a former Peace Corps Volunteer that taught English, I believe the best way to learn and master something is to get to the point where you can teach the material yourself. To that end, you'll find in this repo several lessons (via Jupyter Notebook) that cover various data science topics. These lessons are meant to be accessible to anyone regardless of their education background, so long as they adhere to a few guiding principles:
- Active Learning - you'll only learn by doing, so each lesson has plenty of (hopefully) engaging exercises.
- Inductive Chain Learning - new concepts build upon mastery of old ones.
- Self-Teach - YOU need to be your own best resource. In practice, all that really means is that you need to learn how to Google your questions quickly and efficiently.

# Installation
This project utilizes [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), although I'd recommended that you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) to get Python 3.6 as well a suite of tools including Jupyter Notebook.

Once you've got the tools
 - [clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
 - [navigate to the directory](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) from the command line
 - typer `jupyter notebook` and press Enter. In a moment, Jupyter will be running in your browser.

# Usage
This project is still under construction.
