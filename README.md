# Installation
This project utilizes [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), although it's recommended that you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) to get Python 3.6 as well a suite of tools including Jupyter Notebook.

Once you've got the tools
 - [clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
 - [navigate to the directory](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) from the command line
 - typer `jupyter notebook` and press Enter. In a moment, Jupyter will be running in your browser.

# Usage
This project is still under construction.
