# learning-data-science
A repo for learning data science through Python.
# Description:

A liberal arts student endeavors to learn data science by teaching it. Lessons will cover computer science 101, Python (and eventually R), statistics, and mathematics. These lessons are meant to be accessible to anyone so long as they adhere to these guiding principles:
- Active Learning - you'll only learn by doing, so each lesson has plenty of (hopefully) engaging exercises.
- Inductive Chain Learning - new concepts build upon mastery of old ones.

# Table of Contents:
#### Learn Python
0. Code 101
1. Intro to Python
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. Numbers

2. Introductory Probability (coming soon)
3. Intermediate Statistics (coming soon)
4. Advanced Probability (coming soon)


#### Learn Math

2. Orthogonal Projections (coming soon)
3. Calculus: An Introduction to Integration & Differentiation (coming soon)
4. Markov Chains (coming soon)

# Installation
This project utilizes [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), although it's recommended that you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) to get Python 3.6 as well a suite of tools including Jupyter Notebook.

Once you've got the tools
 - [clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
 - [navigate to the directory](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) from the command line
 - typer `jupyter notebook` and press Enter. In a moment, Jupyter will be running in your browser.

# Usage
This project is still under construction.
