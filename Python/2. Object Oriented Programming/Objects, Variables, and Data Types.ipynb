    "## Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "The first programming languages were all about writing logic to define how data would be processed. In this [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) framework, a program was viewed as a logical sequence that takes input, processes it, and produces output. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) takes the view that we should define our data so that the logic writes itself. In other words, OOP is about programming the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. "

    "In Python, this means that data (also knows as **attributes**) and their **methods** (the things you can do with the data) are bundled together into **instances** of an object type. The **type** of an object refers to the ruleset that constrains the nature of the data and methods within the object. In other words, an object's type determines which data can be stored within an instance of the object as well as the methods that can be applied to the data therein.\n",

    "\n",
    "Take `Bob`. To understand the relationship between his attributes and, say, the `Eat` method, consider how a human's appetite is in part a function of `Weight` and `Height`. That is, the data in `Weight` and `Height` could be variables in the `Eat` method if `Eat` were a mathematical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a human has to have something to eat, so we have to pass an \"edible\" object to the `Eat` method or else `Bob` will go hungry. \n",

    "Enter the `Fruit` class. An instance of the `Fruit` class, e.g. `Apple`, could be passed to the `Eat` method of `Bob`. Once `Bob` \"eats\" the `Apple`, the `Nutrition` attribute of the `Apple` object could result in a change in the `Weight` attribute of the `Human`.\n",
