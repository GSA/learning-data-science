    "\n",
    "#### The Python Function as a Subroutine\n",
    "As we know, Python functions `return` a value. But think for a moment about why we say \"`return`.\" You might recall that, when we call a function, code execution starts at the function's first line and continues until we encounter a `return` statement, `Exception`, or the end of the function, in which case `None` is actually returned. Then, once our function is done, all of its local variables (its state) are lost and we **return** the program to the point at which the function was called. Any new calls to the function would repeat this process. In computer programming, this process is known as a [subroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine).\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all fine and dandy, but once you start working with larger streams of data, there will be times when you want a function that can *yield a series of values* instead of returning a single value and then wiping its state. For a function to do this, it would need to be able to remember its state between each yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did I italicize *yield a series of values* in the paragraph above? I did so because our hypothetical function wouldn't `return` like a typical Python function. As a subroutine, a function `return` means that the function is returning control of code execution to the point in our program where the function was called. `yield` - the Python keyword for defining generators - makes that transfer of control temporary, leaving our function's state intact and expectant of regaining control again in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions that `yield` a series of values are called generators in Python.** Before generators, creating large sequences of data required code that both generated values and kept track of the function's state between calls. Since generators remember their state so to speak, yielding a series of values has become much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generators are a Subtype of Iterators\n",
    "Generators can yield a series of values because they're functions that act like iterators. In fact, they're a subtype of iterators. But what's an iterator? Let's unpack that real quick:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Iteration** is the process of doing something to each item in a sequence of items. Using a loop is an example of iteration. This term is not specific to Python (it's basis is in mathematics).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Iterable** and **iterator** have specific meanings in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> An **iterator** is an object representing a stream of data; this object returns the data one element at a time with the `__next__` method until there are no more elements in the stream, in which case the object raises the `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> An **iterable** is an object that has an `__iter__` method, which returns an iterator, or which defines a  `__getitem__` method that can take sequential indexes starting from zero, raising an `IndexError` when the index exceeds the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> In short, **an iterable is an object that you can get an iterator from**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterators are great because they save memory.** When you instantiate an iterator, the object doesn't contain the whole sequence in memory and will only compute the values from the sequence when you ask for them. This is known as [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) and it's a boon when you're working with large (or infinite!) sequences of data. "

    "Only when we made calls to `next` (or `__next__`) did \"part of\" the generator function's code execute. I say \"part of\" because, as you can see, code execution in a generator stops once a `yield` statement has been reached. So the first `next` call yielded the first value. The second call to `next` then **resumed execution with the state in which the generator had after the first `yield`**. This is the fundamental difference between generators and regular functions: regular functions always start code execution at the top of the function definition and then discard their state once they `return` (or hit an `Exception`). Generators don't discard their state; they suspend it until `next` is called on them again.\n",
